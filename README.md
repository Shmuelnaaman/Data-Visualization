# Data-Visualization
Summary:
The data include secound hand cars for sale that were published in craiglist. Each dot on the scatter plot represents the information of a single car. The Price [$] as the X-axis, the Odometer [Km] as the Y-axis, colors the year model and the number of days since the advertisment was publised as the size of each dot. The main objective of the chart is to be able to see the distribution of the above parameters and the relation between them. 

Design: 
The most important features in the data set are the price and Odometers, therefore I choose to position them along the x and y axis. The color encode the year becouse that make it easy to distingush and identify the spread of one year model. Large dots represents the most relevant cars (published just now), the dots shrinks as the number of days from publication increase. The reason for that choice is to enhance the more relevant cars. Hover on the dots enable us to see the exact price the year and the condition of the car. Click on the dot change the page to the advertisment. Becouse it is important to compare cars that are from the same year I made it posible to use a buttons that filter single years. 

Feedback: After aligning the coars along the x and y axis I was quite happy and I show that to my wife but she did not understand what I was talking about, she wanted to be able to see the price and year when mouse huver on the dots. so I introduce that improvment first. 

After I have done that I added the colors and ask her opinion again so she told me that she canot understand anything and that is too complicated for her and she canot use it becouse she canot look at the advertisment and teh dots do not tell her anything. so I added the option to click the dots and go to the advertisment. 

Next, after I did that obviesly I come to her again , but I added the colors becouse I really thoght it would help, she did not really find any intrest in the colors and wannted to know when each car was published. at that point at least she show intrest so I fix that option and she can see now also the publication time as the size of the dots.
