# Data-Visualization
Summary:

The data include second hand cars for sale that were published in craiglist. Each dot on the scatter plot represents the information of a single car. The Price [$] as the Y-axis, the Odometer [Km] as the X-axis, the model year as colors and the number of days since the advertisement was published as the size of each dot. The main objective of the chart is to reveal the relation between the price of the car the year and the odometer reading. The story about the data set and the explanatory chart demonstrate that: Price is positively correlated with years and negatively correlated with mileage. Clicking on early years, revealed cars with low price and high mileage and as we click on later years the dots slide up and left to represents cars with high price and low mileage. Another side story that the chart tell us is that the price is not correlated with the duration of advertisement. The interpretation of this result indicate that as long that the car price and mileage is in a reasonable range, despite the high correlation between these features there are other parameters that affect the buying.

Design: 

The most important features in the data set are the price and Odometers, therefore I choose to position them along the x and y axis.

The reason for choosing colors to encode the years, is that color enable us to visual grouping of similar colors. Therefore we can distinguish cars of similar years even when they are mixed between other colors.Other encodings does not allow that (for example the size of the circle will not enable us to distinguish between similar circle size). 

I use a scatter plot because that enable us to inspect single cars, this is also the reason that I included the information that pop out on mouse hover and the clickable dots that send the viewer to the advertisement page. I wanted that the viewer will be able to explore the data and perhaps find other interesting relations. 

The figure also enable us to click and choose a single year. The significance of that is for the viewer to be able to see how the correlation values change between different  years.
